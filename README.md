# Parallel Fractal Generation using Mandelbrot And Julia

### Description
* First homework of the Parallel and Distributed Algorithms course.
* The objectives of the application were:
	* Computing Mandelbrot and Julia sets for a polynomial function and displaying them as a grayscale image
	* Implementing a parallel program for the computation
	* Getting used to the pthread library and parallel programming

### Languages
* The project was fully developed in C, using the pthread library for parallel programming.
